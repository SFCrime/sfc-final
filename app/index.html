                <h1>Choosing the Location</h1>
                <p>Our data set included crime for all of San Francisco so choosing an area to focus on was essential. Luckily there were numerous reports about crime in the city that seemed to focus on the Mission District and downtown as hotspots for crime during the World Series win.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>All over the city bonfires were being lit.. One was downtown on Market street. Another was on 19th and Mission. Another on 23rd and Mission. Still another was near the police station on 16th and Valencia which was the scene of raucous Occupy protest a few weeks ago.</p>
                    <p>Eventually a bus was lit on fire around 3rd and Market in the heart of downtown.</p>

                    <p>One person was shot in the arm near 21st and Valencia streets, and second person walked into San Francisco General Hospital with a gunshot wound that he said occurred near 16th and Bryant streets.</p>
                    <p>An argument led to a stabbing near 21st and Valencia Streets, police said, with the victim suffering three wounds and being hospitalized in serious condition.</p>

In our exploration, we isolated a specific area to focus on as a what seemed to be the core location for rioting and problems within the city. </div>
